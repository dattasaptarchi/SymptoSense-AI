Findings\n","\n","*   The system successfully utilizes an SQLite database (`symptosense_ai.db`) to store patient information, doctor details, availability, and appointment schedules across four tables: `patients`, `doctors`, `availability`, and `appointments`.\n","*   A preliminary triage system was implemented using NLTK for basic text processing (tokenization, stop word removal) and rule-based logic to determine patient urgency (\"high\", \"medium\", \"low\") and suggest a relevant medical department based on keywords in reported symptoms.\n","*   The appointment scheduling logic considers patient urgency to define a timeframe (1 day for high, 3 days for medium, 7 days for low), searches for available doctors within the suggested department, checks for availability in the database, and avoids scheduling conflicts by checking existing appointments before booking a slot.\n","*   A command-line interface function (`get_patient_input`) was created to capture patient name and symptoms, integrating user input into the system's workflow.\n","*   The system components (database, triage, scheduling, and user input) are integrated and orchestrated through a `main` function that guides the process from collecting patient information to attempting to schedule an appointment.\n","*   A basic reporting feature (`get_all_appointments`) was added to retrieve and display all scheduled appointments from the database, demonstrating the inclusion of non-API dependent functionalities.\n","\n","### Insights or Next Steps\n","\n","*   Populate the `doctors` and `availability` tables with sample data to fully test the scheduling logic and demonstrate successful appointment booking.\n","*   Enhance the NLP component with more sophisticated symptom analysis and department mapping rules for improved accuracy in triage.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0acb3642"},"source":["## Populate database with sample data\n","\n","### Subtask:\n","Add some sample data
